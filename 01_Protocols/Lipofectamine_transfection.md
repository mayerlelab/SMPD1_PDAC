# Lipofectamin Transfection

## Introduction
This protocol outlines the procedure for CRISPR/Cas vector transfection using Lipofectamin 2000 in DT6606 or KPC1050 cell lines.

## Materials
- Opti-MEM medium
- Lipofectamin 2000
- Puromycin
- D-MEM media + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S)
- 6-well plate
- Plasmid DNA

## Procedure

### Preparation

1. One day before transfection, plate 5 x 10⁵ cells/well in 2 mL/well DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S medium in a 6-well plate.

### 2. Transfection Mixture Preparation

1. For each transfection well, dilute **4 µg of plasmid DNA** in **250 µL Opti-MEM**. (A)

1. Dilute **10 µL Lipofectamin 2000** in **250 µL Opti-MEM**. (B)

1. Incubate A and B separately at room temperature for **5 minutes**.

4. Gently combine both A and B to form a total of **500 µL**.  Incubate the combined mix at room temperature for **20 minutes**.

### 3. Transfection
1. Before transfection, wash cells with PBS and replace media to DMEM + 10% FBS without P/S.

1. Gently add the **500 µL** transfection mixture drop-by-drop to the cells in each well. Mix gently by rocking the plate back and forth to evenly distribute the transfection mixture.

1. For the control well (toxicity control), repeat the above steps but excluding DNA from the transfection mixture.

1. Incubate the plate at 37°C in incubator for 6 hours.

1. After the 6-hour incubation, carefully replace the media with fresh D-MEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S to remove the transfection reagent.

1. The next morning, add 4 µg/mL puromycin (Depending on cell viability after Puromycin standardization) to the wells to select for successfully transfected cells.
