For more details, visit the [product page](https://www.dojindo.com/EUROPE/products/CK04/).

## Materials
- Cell Counting Kit-8 (#CK04-11)
- 96-well Plates
- Cell Culture Medium
- Plate Reader (e.g., SpectraMax® Plus 384 Microplate Reader)
- SMPD1 inhibitor, ARC39 (S1078. Selleckchem, diluted in PBS)
- KrasG12D inhibitor, MRTX1133 (E1051, Selleckchem, diluted in DMSO)

## Procedure

### Assay Protocol

1. Seed cells in a 96-well plate at a density of 1.5 x 10³ cells/well in 100 μl of culture medium. Incubate for 24, 48, and 72 hours at 37°C with 5% CO₂.
 
    (For treatment, seed cells at a density of 5 x 10³ cells/well in 50 μl of culture medium and Incubate Overnight.)

2. After each incubation interval (24, 48, and 72 hours), add 10 μl of WST-8 solution to each well and incubate for an additional 2 hours at 37°C with 5% CO₂.
  
    (For treatment,
   - Add 50 µl of medium containing increasing concentrations of ARC39 (SMPD1 inhibitor) and/or MRTX1133 (KrasG12D inhibitor).
    and Incubate cells with treatments for:
   - 24, 48, and 72 hours for ARC39 treatment in KPC1050 cells.
   - 72 hours for all other treatment conditions.
   - After the specified treatment incubation time, add 10 µl of WST-8 solution to each well. Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C with 5% CO₂.)

3. During incubation, WST-8 is reduced extracellularly in viable cells, using an intermediate electron carrier. This reduction process converts WST-8 into a water-soluble formazan product.

4. Measure the final formazan product by reading the absorbance at 450 nm (OD₄₅₀) using the SpectraMax® Plus 384 Microplate Reader.

5. OD₄₅₀ values are considered proportional to the number of viable cells.

6. For statistical analysis, blank-correct and normalize OD₄₅₀ measurements to the control at 72 hours.
