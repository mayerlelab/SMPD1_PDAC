# Purification and Preparation of Plasmids

## Introduction
This protocol outlines the steps for transformation and plasmid purification using **QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Kits**. It describes the preparation of plasmid DNA from bacterial stab agar cultures, and transformation into DH5α competent cells. 

## Materials

1. LB Medium (25 g of LB in 1 L ddH2O, autoclave, store at 4°C)
1. LB agar plates  with the appropriate antibiotic for selection.
   - 14 g of LB agar in 400 ml (it will not completely dissolve before autoclave)
   - autoclave
   - add selection antibiotics when the solution is warm
   - pipette out ca 15ml LB agar in 10 cm paltes and let it cool 
   - store the solidified plates upside down at 4°C
1. Ampicillin Sodium (Roth HP62.1)
   - Stock solution: 10 mg/ml in ddH₂O, stored at -20°C.  
   - Working concentration: 100 µg/ml.
1. Kanamycin Sulfate (Calbiochem 420311)
   - Stock solution: 50 mg/ml in ddH₂O, stored at -20°C.  
   - Working concentration: 50 µg/ml.
1. Plasmid Plus Kits (QIAGEN 12941)*
   - For high-purity plasmid DNA extraction.
1. Glycerol (Roth 3783.1)  
   - 50% glycerol in LB Medium.

## Procedure

### Preparation of Bacterial Culture from Stab Agar

1. Under sterile conditions, use a sterile pipette tip (flame sterilized) to collect bacteria from the bacterial stab.
1. Mix the bacteria into 600 µl of LB medium in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
1. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes with shaking at 600 rpm in a thermocycler.
1. Using a sterile pipette tip, take 100 µl of the mixture and spread it onto an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.
1. Streak the plate for a single clone.
1. Incubate the plate overnight at 37°C.
1. After incubation, use a sterile pipette tip to pick a single colony.
1. Inoculate 200 ml of LB medium (in an autoclaved Erlenmeyer flask) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.
1. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with shaking at 155 rpm.

### Glycerol Stocks Preparation

1. After overnight incubation, prepare glycerol stocks:
   - Mix 500 µl of bacterial culture with 500 µl of 50% glycerol in LB Medium.
   - Store the glycerol stocks at -80°C for long-term storage.

### Plasmid Purification

1. Purify the plasmid DNA using the **QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Kits** according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### Transformation of Plasmid DNA into Competent Cells

1. Thaw DH5α chemically competent bacteria on ice for 30 minutes.
1. Add 50 µl of the competent bacteria into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
1. Add 500 ng of plasmid DNA to the bacteria.
1. Gently mix the contents by tapping the tube.
1. Incubate the mixture on ice for 12 minutes.
1. Heat shock the tube at 42°C for 2 minutes.
1. Immediately return the tube to ice for another 2 minutes.
1. Add 200 µl of LB medium to the mixture and incubate at 37°C with shaking for 45 minutes.
1. Plate the transformation mixture onto an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.
1. Incubate the plate overnight at 37°C.


### Propagation of Transformed Bacteria

1. After incubation, use a sterile pipette tip to pick a single colony from the agar plate.
1. Inoculate 200 ml of LB medium (in an autoclaved Erlenmeyer flask) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.
1. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with shaking at 155 rpm.

### Glycerol Stock of Transformed Bacteria

1. Prepare glycerol stocks of the transformed bacteria:
   - Mix 500 µl of bacterial culture with 500 µl of 50% glycerol in ddH₂O.
   - Store the glycerol stocks at -80°C.

### Plasmid DNA Purification

1. Purify the plasmid DNA using the **QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Kits** following the manufacturer's protocol.

### Notes
- Sterile techniques should be maintained throughout the procedure to avoid contamination.
- Antibiotics must be freshly prepared or thawed to the correct working concentration before use.
